# The Problem (As Wikipedia Explains It)

[Link Rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot)

> Link rot (also called link death, link breaking, or reference rot) is the phenomenon of hyperlinks tending over time to cease to point to their originally targeted file, web page, or server due to that resource being relocated to a new address or becoming permanently unavailable. A link that no longer points to its target, often called a broken or dead link (or sometimes orphan link), is a specific form of dangling pointer.

> The rate of link rot is a subject of study and research due to its significance to the internet's ability to preserve information. Estimates of that rate vary dramatically between studies.

# A Solution
